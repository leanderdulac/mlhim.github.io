<h3 id="overview">Overview
</h3>

While the broad goals of the MLHIM project is to foster long-term,
semantic and syntactic interoperability across all healthcare related
applications on a global scale.
You do not have to think that big to benefit from MLHIM
technologies.
If you are thinking more on a scale of a company, a locality, a state,
etc.
You can begin building applications that are **inter-operable** AND
require **less maintenance overhead** as  the science of healthcare changes.
The three "big change" complexities in healthcare IT addressed by
MLHIM are: temporal, spatial and ontological.

Be sure to join the discussion forum and/or watch the [introductory videos ] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbDJyng9cm0&feature=plcp&list=PL5BDmBjSV7CtzNPwLnlfL5iCIatBDLBKA) for more details.

Whatever your interest in healthcare IT. You will find helpful

<h3 id="decision-makers">Decision Makers
</h3>

You are in a position where you need to make technical decisions on
creating or updating a healthcare IT infrastructure.
Whether that decision is at a small healthcare corporation, a state
government level or even a national government.
This is a complex field with many choices and those choices usually do
not have a level field of metrics.
When we look at the global stage of healthcare interoperability we see
that there are multiple attempts to define clinical content
standards.
After studying these, we can see that there are distinct differences
in how experts see the conceptual definitions of similar clinical
ideas.
This is because educational, cultural and geo-political situations
affect their perceptions.
So, any type of top down clinical model definition is going to
experience push-back and slow or no adoption. This is defined by the [Cavalini-Cook Theory](img/cavalini_cook_theory.png).
In addition, these all encompassing approaches increase the complexity
of implementation.
This reduces the pool of talent available to even work on development
and maintenance of the systems.

The MLHIM eco-system model approach has learned from decades of
research on a global basis.  The MLHIM approach allows developing
application requirements capability, at any level, to suit the local
needs; along with maintaining interoperability and freedom for
developers choices.

If you would like to discuss your specific needs for healthcare IT
interoperability, feel free to contact one of the persons/companies

<h3 id="educators-students">Educators and Students
</h3>

The MLHIM group has experienced members in the areas of computer
science and health informatics research.

We have developed projects (undergrad through PhD) in multiple
multi-level modelling technologies including MLHIM, openEHR and
ISO13606; as well as projects related to mapping and migration of
legacy data model based applications to multi-level modelling
concepts.

If you have students interested in this area or if you are a student
(please contact your supervisor); please contact Dr. Luciana Tricai
Cavalini at lutricav at mlhim dot org.

She will be happy to provide some first steps advice (or recommend
someone that can)  as well as ongoing collaboration.

<h3 id="knowledge-modellers"> Knowledge Modellers
</h3>

If you are an experienced healthcare knowledge modeller you will want
to see the video on using the CDD Template. It uses the [XMind mind mapping tool] (http://www.xmind.net) with a template representation of the MLHIM reference model.  You can save the template as a new file, create a model by
copying and pasting components from the RM and adding semantic links
to ontologies and vocabularies.

You can get the latest version of the CDD Template [here](http://www.hkcr.net/tools/xmind-templates).  You may also want to explore using the simple CCD spreadsheet tool, xls2ccd   It was designed around migrating legacy data model systems to MLHIM CCDs. Based on the US National Cancer Institute's Common Data Element CRF Standard Template.  The [xls2ccd.zip  package](http://www.hkcr.net/tools/xls2ccd) contains the tool and the spreadsheet template, with examples and instructions.

You will want to create an account over at the [repository](http://www.hkcr.net).  The
instructions are on the first page.  Also, please stop by the forum
and let us know you are taking MLHIM for a test drive.

<h3 id="app-devs"> Application Developers
</h3>

Developers will be pleased to find that you can use your favourite XML
tools for editing, language binding and persistence mapping.  You can
create your software based around an implementation of the reference
model, using binding tool if you like.  Then design your other
application components around processing of the CCD schemas for form
building, messaging and persistence.

The MLHIM team hopes to have
open source reference model implementations for all major programming
languages available in the future (based on 2.4.0 release and beyond).

IF you would like to participate (lead?) in one of these projects
then please sign up on the Launchpad Open Source Health Information
Platform site for your chosen language.     The various OSHIP pages
are in a state of neglect at the moment.  Feel free to volunteer to
upgrade the information there while learning about MLHIM.

The items you'll need to get started are the latest stable development
release of the [Reference Model schema and documentation](https://launchpad.net/mlhim-specs/2.0/2.4.3/+download/mlhim-specs-2013-10-15-2.4.3-Release.zip).  You will
need some CCDs for familiarisation.  You can choose a few from the
[CCD Library](http://www.ccdgegn.com) or you might use the [xls2ccd](http://www.hkcr.net/tools/xls2ccd/view) tool to create your own.  You
should bring any questions you have to the forum.  The <i>About page</i> on the [CCD-Gen](http://www.ccdgen.com/about/) has a great introduction to MLHIM. 
Or just stop in and introduce yourself to let us know you are taking MLHIM for a test drive.
