MLHIM 2.4.0 Released

<div class="well">
I am very pleased to announce that version 2.4.0 of the reference
model specifications as well as the reference implementation are now
available as a final release.
</div>

I am very excited about this release as it represents a level of
stability that is well suited to full on implementation in an
environment.  There has been a great deal of experimental
implementation with this version; without issues.

There are also a significant number of Concept Constraint Definitions
(CCDs) now available on the Healthcare Knowledge Component Repository
site (www.hkcr.net). All based on 2.4.0

The include the complete WHO ICD-10 as diagnosis group concepts and an
example of migrating legacy systems to MLHIM using the US National
Cancer Institute Common Data Element Browser CRF documents.


The MLHIM website (www.mlhim.org) has also received an enormous make
over in order to provide better access to core information.

We have also setup a discussion forum accessible through the website
and/or as a mailing list.  Please register here.

The YouTube video channel is also available directly from MLHIM.org as
well as having a few of the most important videos embedded in the site
for your convenience.

We hope that you will stop in and visit.  Remember that MLHIM is an
open source project with the goal of improving semantic
interoperability between all types of healthcare (and other domain)
applications.  From purpose specific mobile applications to national
information networks.  MLHIM is your 21st foundation for semantic
interoperability.
