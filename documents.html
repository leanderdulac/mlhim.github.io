      Below you'll find links to documents that are specific to MLHIM as well as helpful
      information about multi-level modelling and information systems design.   Information found on the internet about selecting,
      installing and using applications such as an EMR, EHR or others.
      Along with those we will place critiques from the multi-level modelling perspective.
