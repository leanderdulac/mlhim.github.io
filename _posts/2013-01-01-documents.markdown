Below you'll find links to documents that are specific 
to MLHIM as well as helpful information about 
multi-level modelling and information systems design.  
Information found on the internet about selecting, 
installing and using applications such as an EMR, EHR or others. 
Along with those we will place critiques from the multi-level modelling perspective.

This page also has subpages with diagrams that you will find helpful in understanding MLHIM. 
Check the links at the bottom of this page.

Plus 1's will motivate me to do more diagrams and documents.
